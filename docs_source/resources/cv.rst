Computer vision
---------------

Computer vision (CV) is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the automatic and semiautomatic extraction of information from digital images. We recently wrote a review about CV in the context of ecology and evolution. In the paper we give an overview of the field and describe the primary types of image-based data. This might be a good starting point if you are new to digital image analysis and CV altogether.
